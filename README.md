# e-foc — Hardware

A three-phase brushless (BLDC / PMSM) motor driver board designed to run the
[**e-foc** Field-Oriented Control firmware](https://github.com/embedded-pro/e-foc).

This repository contains the **KiCad** electrical design — schematics, project
configuration and (eventually) the PCB layout — for the power and signal-chain
hardware that the e-foc control software targets. The microcontroller itself
lives on a pluggable module; this board provides the power stage, gate drive,
current sensing, protection and peripheral connectivity around it.

> **Scope:** this repo is the *hardware*. For the control algorithms (Clarke/Park
> transforms, Space Vector Modulation, current/velocity PID loops, auto-tuning),
> see the [firmware repository](https://github.com/embedded-pro/e-foc).

## Highlights

- **Three-phase inverter** built from three TI `CSD88537ND` 60 V dual NexFET™
  half-bridge power blocks (one per phase) — low R<sub>DS(on)</sub>, sized for a
  50 V bus at 5 A.
- **`FAN7888` 3-phase gate driver** with bootstrap high-side supply for clean,
  cross-conduction-protected switching.
- **Low-side shunt current sensing** (0.02 Ω) on each phase, amplified and
  filtered through a dedicated `TLV9062` / `TLV9064` analog conditioning stage
  for the controller's ADC.
- **Wide-input switching power supply** — `LM5164` 100 V synchronous buck plus
  `AMS1117` linear regulators generating the +15 V gate-drive rail, +5 V and
  +3.3 V logic rails, with TVS bus-clamp protection (`SMCJ51A`).
- **CAN connectivity** via an `SN65HVD230` transceiver for multi-axis /
  networked control.
- **Non-volatile storage** — `24LC04` I²C EEPROM (calibration / parameters) and
  `W25Q32` 32-Mbit SPI flash (logs / firmware assets).
- **MCU-agnostic carrier** — the controller plugs in over a 24-pin (2×12)
  header, matching the firmware's `PlatformFactory` abstraction (e.g. STM32F407
  or TI Tiva TM4C1294 modules).

## Board architecture

The design is organised as hierarchical schematic sheets, each a self-contained
functional block:

| Sheet | Function | Key parts |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| `e-foc.kicad_sch` | Top-level sheet wiring all blocks together | — |
| `power-supply` | Wide-input supply: gate-drive + logic rails, protection | `LM5164`, `AMS1117-3.3`, `SMCJ51A` (D1 bus TVS) |
| `driver` | Three-phase inverter, gate drive, phase shunts, motor terminals | `FAN7888`, 3× `CSD88537ND`, 0.02 Ω shunts |
| `adc-conditioner` | Current/voltage sense amplification & anti-alias filtering | `TLV9062`, `TLV9064` |
| `microcontroller-connector` | 2×12 header to the MCU module + signal break-out | `Conn_02x12` |
| `can-bus` | CAN field-bus interface | `SN65HVD230` |
| `serial-com` | Serial / debug communications | — |
| `eeprom-mem` | I²C EEPROM for calibration & parameters | `24LC04` |
| `flash-mem` | SPI NOR flash for logging / assets | `W25Q32JVSS` |

## Design requirements (spec)

These are the **hard design targets** the board must meet — the authoritative
requirements used for design review and sign-off.

| # | Requirement | Target |
|---|-------------|--------|
| R1 | Input bus voltage | **50 V** max |
| R2 | Output current | **5 A** max continuous (DC) |
| R3 | Motor types | 3-phase brushless (BLDC) / PMSM, **FOC** control |
| R4 | PWM switching frequency | **50 kHz** max |
| R5 | Configuration storage | **EEPROM** available for parameters / calibration |
| R6 | Firmware-update storage | **External flash** for FW update |
| R7 | Field-bus | **CAN @ 1 Mbps** max, **GND present in the connector** |
| R8 | PCB stack-up | **2 layers** is sufficient |
| R9 | Position feedback | input for **encoder OR hall sensor** |

### As-built component capability

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Power topology | 3× half-bridge (1 dual FET per phase), low-side shunt sensing |
| Switching devices | TI `CSD88537ND`, 60 V dual N-channel NexFET™ half-bridge (Q1–Q3) — 10 V margin over the 50 V bus (R1) |
| Bus TVS clamp | D1 = `SMCJ51A`, 51 V standoff / 1500 W (see note below) |
| Gate driver | `FAN7888`, 3-phase, bootstrap high-side |
| Current sense | 0.02 Ω low-side shunt per phase + op-amp gain stage |
| Logic rails | +3.3 V logic + gate-drive rail (FAN7888 VDD) |
| Protection | TVS bus clamp (`SMCJ51A`), CAN ESD array, gate clamps |
| Comms | CAN (`SN65HVD230`, R7), serial / debug |
| Storage | I²C EEPROM (`24LC04`, R5), SPI flash (`W25Q32`, 32 Mbit, R6) |
| Controller | External 24-pin MCU module (STM32 / TI Tiva, via firmware abstraction) |

> **D1 TVS sizing.** The bus is 50 V max; the `CSD88537ND` is a 60 V FET. A
> standard TVS cannot both stand off 50 V *and* clamp below 60 V (clamp ratio
> ~1.5×), so `SMCJ51A` (Vrwm 51 V, Vbr ≥ 56.7 V, Vc ≈ 82 V) is chosen to absorb
> gross load-dump / inductive transients without conducting in normal operation.
> The 10 V FET margin against **switching ringing** must be held by layout —
> tight commutation loop, adequate bulk capacitance, and (if needed) an RC
> snubber — not by the TVS. Compliance with R1–R9 is confirmed during design
> review and bring-up.

> Each board is a self-contained KiCad project in its own `hardware/<board>/`
> folder — the `.kicad_pro`, root schematic and board share that folder (KiCad
> locates them by name and path). Hierarchical sub-sheets and project symbol libs

## Getting started

This is a [**KiCad 10**](https://www.kicad.org/) project.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/embedded-pro/e-foc-hw.git
   cd e-foc-hw
   ```
2. Open `hardware/e-foc/e-foc.kicad_pro` (or
   `hardware/tiva-80pin-adapter/tiva-80pin-adapter.kicad_pro`) in KiCad.
3. Open the schematic editor to browse the hierarchical sheets, or the PCB
   editor for the board layout.

### Headless checks (the same ones CI runs)

With KiCad 8+ installed you can run electrical / design-rule checks locally:

```bash
kicad-cli sch erc  --output erc.json --format json hardware/e-foc/e-foc.kicad_sch
kicad-cli pcb drc  --output drc.json --format json hardware/e-foc/e-foc.kicad_pcb
```

Or use the export helpers (any board): `python scripts/export_review.py` for the
e-foc board, `python scripts/export_review.py --name tiva-80pin-adapter` for the
adapter; `scripts/export_jlcpcb.py` likewise for the fab/assembly package.

## Continuous integration

Every push and pull request that touches a schematic or board file is checked by
[**kicad-bot**](https://github.com/embedded-pro/kicad-bot) — a CI quality gate
that wraps `kicad-cli`, KiBot, KiCost and KiDiff to run:

- **ERC / DRC verification** — electrical and design-rule checks.
- **BOM availability** — distributor stock / lifecycle (end-of-life) flags.
- **Visual diffs** — schematic & PCB change previews on pull requests.

The workflow lives in [`.github/workflows/kicad-bot.yml`](.github/workflows/kicad-bot.yml)
and uploads a `kicad-bot-output/` artifact (report, metrics, raw violation data).

> kicad-bot is a CI guardrail, **not** a substitute for design review or sign-off.

To enable distributor BOM pricing/availability, add the relevant API keys as
repository secrets (`MOUSER_KEY`, `DIGIKEY_CLIENT_ID`, `DIGIKEY_CLIENT_SECRET`).

All third-party actions are **pinned to a full commit SHA** (with the version in a
trailing comment) for supply-chain hardening.

## Releases

Releases are automated with [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please)
and driven by [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
(`feat:`, `fix:`, …). The flow ([`.github/workflows/release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml)):

1. Commits to `main` keep an open **release PR** with the next version bump and
   `CHANGELOG.md` entries.
2. Merging that PR cuts a **GitHub Release** and tag.
3. On release, kicad-bot re-runs **ERC/DRC** (gating the release on a clean
   design), resolves the **BOM**, and produces **Gerbers / drill / position**
   files. These are zipped into `e-foc-hw-<version>.zip` and attached to the
   release as a downloadable fabrication package.

Version state is tracked in [`.release-please-manifest.json`](.release-please-manifest.json);
behaviour is configured in [`release-please-config.json`](release-please-config.json).
